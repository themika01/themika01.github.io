            <p>This article is broken into distinct sections. The first main section is in quick information, the map, and the timeline: this is where you will find pure 
                factual dates and information about events. Refer to this section for the "what, when, and where". The second section is multiple 
                written chapters which are designed to be self-contained, and are 
                explicitly historical interpretation - refer to them for the "why and how". Be aware that every chapter - some more than others - contains discussions of 
                extreme violence, racism, genocide, etc. There are some images on the page that may be disturbing - the most graphic of which will be blurred with a description 
                until you click to reveal the photograph if you want to see it.</p>

            <h3 class="center">Racism, Antisemitism, and Genocide</h3>
            <h3>Short Summary</h3>
            <p>The Italian conquests in Africa were heavily influenced by the racist idea that Europeans "should" have a colonial empire. The wars in Africa 
                themselves then came back and influenced the development of Fascist racism in the 1920s and 1930s. To maintain their empire the Fascists 
                justified violence against Africans using white supremacy. While antisemitism had always existed in Italy, it was usually along religious lines rather than 
                "biological" inheritable race. However, as Fascists relied on ideas of race to justify the oppression of Africans, they then used race to justify the oppression 
                of Jews as well. This culminated with the 1938 <em>Manifesto of Italian Racism</em> and the subsequent laws passed by the Fascist Grand Council. Despite the 
                horrific crimes of the Fascist regime many of these atrocities have been under-represented in Italian culture and historical study due to political and cultural stigmas.</p>
            <h3>Genocide in Libya</h3>
                <p>Libya had maintained a staunch anti-colonial religious society called the Sanusiyya Order from the late 1800s. When the Italians 
                    invaded and occuppied Libya in 1911, they came into immediate conflict with the Sanussi<sup>1</sup>. Libya was where the Italian 
                    government began their racist policies, even before the Fascists took power. The Italians sought to break the power of the Sanusi order 
                    by exiling known members of the group, and between 1911 and 1928 exiled around 1,500 people into prison-colonies<sup>2</sup>. Mussolini's 
                    plan to re-create the Roman Empire caused a severe escalation of Italian racism beginning in 1928.</p>

                <p>In 1928 Mussolini ordered the generals in charge of the Libyan campaign - Rodolfo Graziani and Pietro Badoglio - to "pacify" Libya at all costs. 
                    Pietro Badoglio considered the population of Libya - mostly rural tribesfolk - to be an acceptable cost. To "pacify" Libya he 
                    planned to build concentration camps to hold the entire population of the northeastern region of Libya. In a letter from June 1930 
                    Badoglio said about the plan:</p>
                <p class="center bigger">"I do not conceal from myself the significance and the gravity of this action which may well spell the ruin of the so-called subject population."<sup>3</sup></p>
                <p>The concentration camps began construction in 1928, and ran until 1934. Over that period of time the Fascists forced over 100,000 Libyans into the camps. 
                    Death did not begin in the camps, but on forced marches across hundreds of miles of open desert. The herds of Libyan tribespeople were also forced to march; 
                    some 80-95% of livestock - which the tribesfolk relied on for food and property - died<sup>4</sup>. The largest camps had conditions such as a 
                    complete lack of medical care, starvation-level rations, and no ability for those interned to wash or get new clothes<sup>5</sup>. Between 60 and 70 thousand Libyan people died 
                    during the genocide<sup>6</sup>. Hundreds of thousands of other Libyans were also forced to abandon their homes and flee the country.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>The legacy of genocide is still felt in Libya, and largely ignored in Italy. Survivors of the concentration camps, and their children and grandchildren, 
                    are alive today. Because of low literacy rates among tribespeople, the genocide is mainly remembered through poetry and oral tradition. This includes 
                    epic poems by those interred in camps such as Rajab Hamad Buhwaish al-Minifi's <em>Mabi-Marad</em> (I have no Illness except Agaila Concentration Camp) 
                    and Fatima 'Uthamn's <em>Kharabin Ya Watan</em> (Our Homeland Ruined Twice)<sup>7</sup>. <em>Mabi-Marad</em> was played often on radio stations 
                    throughout Libya in the 1950s, and is easily recitable for many Libyans<sup>8</sup>. The genocide is mostly unknown or ignored in Italy. 
                    The Italian government only tacitly accepted responsiblity for atrocities - but not genocide - in Libya as recently as 1998. The General Rodolfo 
                    Graziani, known as the "Butcher of Libya", had a statue erected in his honor in his hometown in 2012 dedicated to their "most famous of sons"<sup>9</sup>.

            <h3>Development of Racism and Antisemitism in Law</h3>
                <p>The conquests of Libya and Ethiopia in Africa influenced the development of Fascist racists beliefs and laws back in Italy during the 1920s and '30s.</p>
            <h3>Historiography</h3>
                <p>After World War Two, most historians focused on the rise and fall of the Nazi regime in Europe and ignored 
                    other Fascist movements within and outside of Europe. This was especially true of Italy for a series of political and cultural reasons. After the war the Italian Communist Party was the strongest Communist party in non-Soviet Europe, and both the US and the UK 
                    took that as "good reason" to not weaken the Italian right wing by attacking the Fascist regime<sup>10</sup>. Italian Fascists 
                    remained in charge of the Italian government archives after the end of the war. This allowed them to systematically remove, alter, or destroy 
                    documents showing the full extent of atrocities committed by Mussolini's regime<sup>11</sup>. Additionally, while Nazi officials 
                    were tried for their crimes, Italian officials were never tried. This was despite numerous attempts by the governments of Ethiopia and Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>Within Italy, there was a desire to separate the Italian people from the evils of the Fascist regime. This led to the creation of the "Good Italian Myth", 
                    which states that most Italians secretly hated Mussolini but felt too threatened to do anything<sup>12</sup>. In this myth, the people of Italy are framed as innocent 
                    victims of the Fascist regimes, rather than perpetrators of the crimes. The Italian government has never felt much need to dispell this myth, especially with                     the genocides and atrocities committed in African colonies.</p>
                <p>Because of this, historians - especially English speaking ones - have only recently began unpacking the nature of hatred in Fascist Italy. 
                    Some Italian historians began delving into Fascist anti-Jewish laws in the 1970s. The most comprehensive English book on Italian antisemitism 
                    was published in 2014. Only very recently have historians looked into the cases of Ethiopia and especially Libya. The Italian archives continue to be 
                    reluctant - at best - to release details on those atrocities<sup>13</sup>. Essentially the only comprehensive English book on the genocide in Libya written 
                    so far was published in 2021. Research on the oppression and ethnic cleansing of people in Fascist Italy is an ongoing process which affects the survivors and descendants of 
                    those atrocities today.</p>
