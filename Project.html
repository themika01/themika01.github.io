                <h3>What does the acronym stand for?</h3>
                <p>LGBT stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender. The + at the end is a shortening of the full acronym - what letters fit into it, and what each one means, changes based on who you ask. In general, the full spectrum expands to include more sexualities, such as Aromantic/Asexual people, and also more gender identities, such as the Indigenous American Two-Spirit identity.</p>

                <h3>The History of the acronym</h3>
                <p>The LGBT+ acronym has its origins in the gay rights movement, which originally was simply called the gay rights movement - or, sometimes the gay and lesbians rights movement. Starting in the 1980s this grew to include Bisexual people, marking the first version of the acronym as "LGB". Later, especially beginning in the 1990s, as Transgender people became more accepted within the community, the acronym was expanded to "LGBT". The addition of more letters has been a more recent development, and has been especially spurred on by the internet and the flourishing of individual LGBT activism, and so the "+" at the end indicates the many different versions of the acronym, such as "LGBTQIA", "LGBTQQ", "LGBTQ2S", etc. In general today, LGBT+ refers to anybody who exists outside of the <b>heteronormative</b> lifestyle.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="acronym-history mt-3">
                <h3>What is heteronormativity?</h3>
                <p><em>Heteronormativity</em> is the societal idea that being straight and cisgendered is normal and the "default" way of existing. Anything other than being straight and cis in a heteronormative society is considered, if not outright evil and threatening, strange and to be avoided. Heteronormativity is important to understand as a deeply ingrained public sensibility that presents itself in many ways. Heteronormativity does not just present itself as explicit homophobia, but also implicitly - for example, somebody who follows a heteronormative viewpoint may feel surprised and betrayed if their favorite TV show character is revealed to be gay - even if they supported LGBT+ rights on a political level. Somebody doesn't necessarily have to be outright and proudly bigoted to hold a subconscious view that certain sexualities are "normal" and others are "strange".</p>

                    <h3>Gay rights before stonewall</h3>
                    <p>Before 1969, the gay rights movement in the USA existed mainly as a smaller section of the larger Civil Rights movement and sexual revolution. The objective of gay rights activism was less focused on changing American culture to include gay people, but more showing off to America that gay people could fit in to American cuture. A good example of this is the annual reminder - a photo of which is shown on the left - which was an annual march held in front of a government building during the 1960s. Note that the signs here use the word homosexual, rather than gay, and how formally dressed they all are, and the presence of the American flag. In fact, the annual reminder had a very strict dress-code. The goal was to present gay people as "just as normal as the rest of society".</p>

                    <h3>The Stonewall Riot</h3>
                    <p>The Stonewall Bar was a gay bar in New York City during the 1960s. During this time period, the NYC government refused to give out liquor liscences to bars known to serve gay people so that police would have an excuse to harrass them. This occurred in Stonewall, but in 1969 patrons of the bar resisted arrest, protested, and eventually as word spread through the NYC gay community, the incident evolved into multiple days of rioting.</p>

                    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
                    <p>The Stonewall riots were not conducted by the same protestors who organized the Annual Reminder. The stonewall riots were conducted by drunk gay men attending a bar, by drag queens, and by random people from New York City. This inspired various different organizations fighting for gay rights, such as the Gay Liberation Front, to change their tactics. The idea would no longer be about placing gay people inside of American culture, but about expanding American culture to include gay people, regardless of their appearance, status, etc. There would be no more strict dress codes, nor usage of an old scientific term with negative connotations - homosexual - but instead a new and exciting word: gay. In 1970, on the 1-year anniversary of the Stonewall riot, pride parades were held in New York, LA, and other cities. </p>

                <h3>The Gay Rights Movement in 1970</h3>
                <p>In her book <em>Pride Parades</em>, Katherine Bruce writes that the purpose of Pride in the 1970s was to proclaim the "cultural worth of gays and lesbians". Notably absent from this message are bisexuals and transgender people. While Bruce does note that drag queens, crossdressers, and other gender-noncomformists participated in the marches, it's left unclear whether or not trans people participated. It is worth noting, again, that the T in LGBT was not added until the 1980s. The gay rights movement was also headed almost entirely by white gay men, which of course affected the main focus of the group. While women and people of color were never explicitly excluded from the gay rights movement, white gay men were the largest group in the leadership and membership of the movement. This is the main reason this section refers to the movement as the "gay rights movement" rather than the "LGBT+" movement - it simply was not fully LGBT inclusive at this point in time.</p>
                <p>While pride parades were certainly affecting American culture and the visibility of gay people, legal progress was extremely slow. Gay marriage was not legal anywhere in the USA, and would not become so until Massachusetts became the first state to do so in 2004. The LA Pride Parade in 1970 almost didn't happen - or would have happened in a much different character - as it lacked institutional support. The police chief of LA attempted to prevent the protest from getting permission to occur, his logic being that gay people were inherently morally compromised - "We would be ill-advised to discommode the people to have a burglars' or robbers' parade or a homosexuals' parade."</p>

                <h2>The LGBT+ Movement Today</h2>
                <p>In 2015 gay marriage was legalized across the USA via supreme court decision. This was a massive victory for the LGBT+ movement - but it is not the end of the road. Within gay and lesbian rights, there are still many states that lack discrimination protection in jobs for LGBT+ people. Additionally, transgender rights are under attack in many states across the USA today. This follows a sort of 'last-hired-first-fired' trend for conservative backlash to LGBT+ rights - the battle against gay marriage is seen as 'lost', and so now the focus shifts to the group that still has not obtained their full rights - transgender people. Because of this, the LGBT+ movement must also shift its focus.</p>

                    <h3>Insitutional support</h3>
                    <p>In addition to the legal recognition of gay marriage, Pride has been successful in ingraining its message within American culture and politics. Today, many political institutions in the US are openly supportive of Pride events - for example, the University of Utah sponsored their own Pride parade in 2021. In the south, the University of Tennessee simply had an article on their website directing people to other websites that discussed LGBT+ history. Current president Joe Biden has tweeted support for the LGBT+ movement, and hung pride flags from the white house. It is debatable how much of this is <em>real</em> support for LGBT+ rights - as nice as website articles and tweets are, they are not actual institutional change. That being said, if nothing else all of these are signs that LGBT+ rights are now popular enough to be advertized by universities and politicians hoping for re-election.</p>

                    <h3>Commercialization</h3>
                    <p>As pride has grown more popular, it has recieved institutional support not just from the government but also from corporations. This is an issue that is more controversial within and without the Pride movement. It a good thing to show off being openly gay while protesting for the rights of yourself and others - but being sponsored by Pepsi while doing so may muddy the message. This phenomenon can also be a distraction from 'actual' political issues that are much more important - instead of having a candid debate about the place of transgender people in American society, it is easy for politicians and pundits to change the subject and simply complain about how Pride has become corporate - "how could these people be oppressed if so many companies have rainbow pictures on their twitters for a month?".</p>

            <div id="trans-rights">
                <h3>Shifting Focus</h3>
                <p>Today, the fight for gay marriage having been won, lesbians, gays, and bisexuals stand at a fairly decent spot within American society. This is not to say everything is perfect - in fact, since the legal argument that got gay marriage legalized relied on precedent from Roe v. Wade, now overturned, gay marriage could even be at risk in the near future. For the moment, though, the focus of the pride movement is generally shifting onto the rights of other communities within the movement. An interviewee at Chicago Pride 2022 put it candidly: "Pride right now is not about white men anymore. It's about our marginzalied communities within the gay community." This especially includes those whose rights are currently under national scrutiny, such as transgender people, and those who do not benefit from race and class privileges, such as LGBT+ people of color.</p>
                <p>This shift is not just a move to fight for people's rights. It is also a somewhat necessary pivot to remain politically relevant. Ever since the victory of gay marriage in 2015, the American public largely considers the fight for gay rights as "won" - whether or not that's actually true. To remain politically relevant the Pride movement therefore needs to find new grounds to fight on. This does not make the fight for the rights of transgender people and other minorities less important or less genuine, but it does mean that other issues, such as discrimination against openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual people in the job market can get left on the backburner.</p>
