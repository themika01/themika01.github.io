            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>In the United States, LGBT+ people have only come into the public consciousness relatively recently. In fact, the acronym LGBT+ and its meanings have only truly entered widespread use in the last decade or two. The evolution of the Gay Rights Movement into the LGBT Movement, and now finally the LGBT+ rights movement, demonstrates the growing strength and intersectionality of the movement. The LGBT+ rights movement was written on extensively by Katherine Bruce in her book <a href="https://arizona-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/evot53/01UA_ALMA51843864320003843"><em>Pride Parades</em></a>, which is a major source for much of the history in this paper. In the book, Bruce develops a historical account of pride parades from the first one in 1970 and discusses how the movement looks today. Her main sources were accounts and interviews with attendees of those pride parades. Bruceâ€™s book is an important source in studying the history of the first pride parade, and how the gay rights movement expanded to include transgender and bisexual people. Today, the LGBT+ movement has many different strengths, such as its intersectionality, and weaknesses, such as the slowness of the transition from cultural change to institutional, legal change. The LGBT+ Pride movement needs to make some adaptations to continue being a strong political force into the future.</p>

                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT">LGBT</a> stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender. The + at the end is a shortening of 
                    the full acronym which has different meanings based on who 
                    you ask. In general, the full spectrum expands to include more sexualities, such as 
                    Aromantic/Asexual people, and also more gender identities, such as the Indigenous American 
                    Two-Spirit identity. You can read more about the full acronym, and various other LGBT+ terms,

            <div class="acronym-history mt-3">
                <h3>The History of the acronym</h3>
                <p>The LGBT+ acronym has its origins in what was originally 
                    called the gay rights movement, or sometimes the gay and lesbian rights movement <a href="https://arizona-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/evot53/01UA_ALMA51843864320003843">(Bruce, 32)</a>. 
                    Starting in the 1980s this grew to include bisexual people, marking the first version 
                    of the acronym as "LGB". Later, especially beginning in the 1990s as Transgender people 
                    became more accepted within the community, the acronym was expanded to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT">"LGBT"</a>. The addition 
                    of more letters has been a recent development, and has been spurred on by the 
                    internet and the flourishing of individual LGBT activism, and so the "+" at the end indicates 
                    the many different versions of the acronym, such as "LGBTQIA", "LGBTQQ", "LGBTQ2S", etc. In 
                    general, today LGBT+ refers to anybody who exists outside of the <em>heteronormative</em> 
                    lifestyle.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="acronym-history mt-3">
                <h3>What is heteronormativity?</h3>
                <p><em>Heteronormativity</em> is the societal idea that being straight and cisgendered is the normal 
                    and "default" way of existing. Anything other than being straight and cis in a 
                    heteronormative society is considered, if not outright evil and threatening, strange and to be 
                    avoided. Heteronormativity is important to understand as a deeply ingrained public sensibility 
                    that presents itself in many ways. Heteronormativity is not just explicit 
                    homophobia, but also implicit, subconscious biases - for example, somebody who follows a heteronormative 
                    viewpoint may feel surprised and betrayed if their favorite TV show character is revealed to 
                    be gay - even if they support LGBT+ rights on a political level. Somebody doesn't 
                    necessarily have to be outright and proudly bigoted to hold a subconscious view that 
                    certain sexualities are "normal" and others are "strange". Heteronormativty is one of the main things that 
                    Pride parades seek to combat, by presenting LGBT+ people and culture as fun, normal, and happy, rather than a strange thing 
                    on the sidelines of "normal" society.</p>

            <h3>Gay rights before stonewall</h3>
            <div class="row">
                <div id="old-image" class="col-md-6" title="Image of protestors at the Annual Reminder"></div>
                <div class="col-md-6 my-auto">
                    <p>Before 1969, the gay rights movement in the USA existed mainly as a smaller section of the 
                        larger Civil Rights movement and sexual revolution. The objective of gay rights activism 
                        was less focused on changing American culture to include gay people, and more on showing off 
                        that gay people could fit in to American culture. A good example of this is the 
                        annual reminder - a photo of which is included here <a href="https://arizona-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/evot53/01UA_ALMA51843864320003843">(Bruce, 34)</a> - which was an annual march held 
                        in front of a government building during the 1960s. Note that the signs here use the word 
                        homosexual, rather than gay, the presence of 
                        the American flag, and how formally dressed they all are. In fact, the annual reminder had a very strict dress code<a href="https://arizona-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/evot53/01UA_ALMA51843864320003843">(Bruce, 34)</a>. 
                        The goal of the Annual Reminder was to present gay people as "just as normal as the rest of American society".</p>

                    <h3>The Stonewall Riot</h3>
                    <p>The Stonewall Inn was - and still is - a gay bar in New York City. During the 1960s, 
                        the NYC government refused to give out liquor licenses to bars known to serve gay people 
                        so that police would have an excuse to harass them <a href="https://arizona-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/evot53/01UA_ALMA51843864320003843">(Bruce, 39)</a>. This occurred in Stonewall, but in 
                        1969 patrons of the bar resisted arrest, protested, and eventually as word spread through 
                        the NYC gay community, the incident evolved into multiple days of rioting.</p>

                <div id="march-image" class="col-md-6" title="Image of a man holding a sign that says 'gay is good' at Pride 1970"></div>
                <div class="col-md-6 my-auto">
                    <p>The Stonewall Riots were not conducted by the same protestors who organized the Annual 
                        Reminder. The Riots were conducted by drunk gay men attending a bar, by drag 
                        queens, people from all parts of the LGBT+ spectrum, and importantly, 
                        lower-class city folk rather than the usual white, suburban middle class protestors who were more common
                        at the Annual Reminder. This inspired various different 
                        organizations fighting for gay rights, such as the Gay Liberation Front, to change their 
                        tactics. The idea would no longer be about placing gay people inside of American culture, 
                        but about expanding American culture to include gay people, regardless of their appearance, status, 
                        etc. There would be no more strict dress codes, nor usage of an old scientific term with negative 
                        connotations - homosexual - but instead a new and exciting word: gay <a href="https://arizona-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/evot53/01UA_ALMA51843864320003843">(Bruce, 39)</a>. In 1970, on the 
                        1-year anniversary of the Stonewall riot, pride parades were held in New York, LA, and other cities. </p>
                </div>
                <p>These pride parades were celebratory in tone. The idea was to create a fun and inclusive environment 
                    to influence American culture, rather than staging a traditional protest march that would risk 
                    state violence. This was especially true of the march in LA, where the request for a permit to protest 
                    included the possibility that an elephant would march through the streets <a href="https://arizona-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/evot53/01UA_ALMA51843864320003843">(Bruce, 49)</a>. By doing this, the Pride marchers 
                    aimed to invite bystanders to join in on the celebrations and see that gay and lesbian people were not 
                    strange or worrisome, but that being gay or lesbian could in fact be freeing and fun. By doing this, they hoped, 
                    they could influence American culture by showing that opening society to openly gay people would 
                    benefit society at large.

            <div class="mt-3">
                <h3>The Gay Rights Movement in 1970</h3>
                <p>While pride parades were certainly affecting American culture and the visibility of gay people, legal progress was extremely slow. Gay marriage would not become legal anywhere in the USA until Massachusetts became the first state to legalize it in 2004. The LA Pride Parade in 1970 almost didn't happen - or would have happened in a much different character - as it lacked institutional support. The police chief of LA attempted to prevent the protest from getting permission to occur, his logic being that gay people were inherently morally compromised - "We would be ill-advised to discommode the people to have a burglars' or robbers' parade or a homosexuals' parade." <a href="https://arizona-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/evot53/01UA_ALMA51843864320003843">(Bruce, 45)</a> It would take a lot of slow progress to change culture enough to affect the legal standing of LGBT people.</p>
                <p>In Pride Parades, Katherine Bruce writes that the purpose of Pride in the 1970s was to proclaim the "cultural worth of gays and lesbians"<a href="https://arizona-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/evot53/01UA_ALMA51843864320003843">(32)</a>. Notably absent from this message are bisexuals and transgender people - this despite the fact that many transgender people participated in the Stonewall Riot. It is worth noting, again, that the T in LGBT was not added until the 1980s. The gay rights movement was also headed almost entirely by white gay men, which of course affected the main focus of the group. While women and people of color were never explicitly excluded from the gay rights movement, white gay men were the largest demographic in the leadership and membership of the movement<a href="https://arizona-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/evot53/01UA_ALMA51843864320003843">(Bruce, 58)</a>. This is the main reason this section refers to the movement as the "gay rights movement" rather than the "LGBT+" movement - it simply was not fully LGBT inclusive at this point in time. This would change as the Pride movement grew in the coming decades.</p>

                <h2>The Expanding Movement: Transgender Rights</h2>
                <p>Through the 1970s and for some time during the 1980s, transgender people - and bisexual people - 
                    were largely considered to be outside the purview of the gay rights movement <a href="https://arizona-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/evot53/01UA_ALMA51843864320003843">(Bruce, 27)</a>. This led to two 
                    different phenomena: transgender activists either pushing for further inclusion of transgender 
                    people within the pride movement, or deciding to organize their own separate protest marches. 
                    Transgender specific 
                    protests are still held today <a href="https://arizona-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/evot53/01UA_ALMA51843864320003843">(Bruce, 195)</a>, and are sometimes associated with pride organizations, and 
                    sometimes held and organized entirely separately. This is, in some ways, a result of the 
                    inherent difference between advocacy for the rights associated with someone's sexual preferences 
                    and someone's gender identity. While the legalization of gay marriage in 2015 was a huge victory 
                    for lesbians, gays, and bisexuals, the same cannot be said for transgender people.</p>
                    <div class="row mt-3">
                        <div class="col-md-6 my-auto">
                            <p>Today, transgender people are generally accepted as a celebrated and necessary part of the 
                                LGBT+ community. That said, the inclusion of trans people in the pride movement is still a 
                                developing phenomenon. The acronym of LGB<em>T</em> did not enter popular use until the '90s. 
                                Reactionary groups within the pride movement, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGB_Alliance">LGB alliance</a>, still seek to exclude 
                                transgender people from pride. Katherine Bruce, who interviewed many trans people at Pride events for her book, 
                                noted a common sentiment that "lesbians, gays, and bisexuals are willing to 'throw [trans people] 
                                under the bus' to get their own legal protections." <a href="https://arizona-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/evot53/01UA_ALMA51843864320003843">(Bruce, 196)</a> In general, however, the LGBT+ movement as 
                                a whole is beginning to shift its focus towards trans rights. This is especially true due to 
                                transgender people's rights currently being under much heavier national scrutiny than 
                                other sections of the LGBT+ spectrum.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-6" id="trans-image" title="Image of a trans flag being waved at a pride march."></div>
                    </div>
                    <p class="mt-3">Katherine Bruce notes that the reason for the inclusion of transgender 
                    people in the LGBT rights movement is due to the overlap of sexuality and gender in most western 
                    cultures <a href="https://arizona-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/evot53/01UA_ALMA51843864320003843">(197)</a>. In traditional American culture, the idea of "being a man" is inherently tied to the 
                    idea of being heterosexual - men should marry women and have children to form a nuclear family - 
                    and therefore simply by existing gay and bisexual men call into question American gender roles. The 
                    idea applies similarly for lesbian and bisexual women as well. Transgender people do this 
                    much more explicitly by openly identifying as a gender unrelated to their sex. Because of this, 
                    any cultural force or legal legislation that reinforces heteronormative sexual and gender roles is certain 
                    to harm all members of the LGBT+ community, regardless of their specific sexuality or gender identity.</p>

                <h2>Challenges Facing The LGBT+ Movement Today</h2>
                <p>In 2015 gay marriage was legalized across the USA via supreme court decision. This was a massive victory 
                    for the LGBT+ movement - but it is not the end of the road. There are 
                    still many states that lack discrimination protection in the job market for openly lesbian, gay, or bisexual people. 
                    Additionally, transgender rights are under attack in many states across the USA today - such as the 
                    <a href="https://apnews.com/article/desantis-florida-lgbtq-education-health-c68a7e5fe5cf22ab8cca324b00644119">
                        multitude of anti-trans bills passed by Florida governor Ron Destantis</a>. 
                        This follows a sort of 'last-hired-first-fired' trend for reactionary backlash to LGBT+ rights - the battle 
                        against gay marriage is seen as 'lost', and so now the focus shifts to the group that still has not obtained 
                        their full rights - transgender people. Note that this is a <em>reactionary</em> backlash, not solely a traditional 
                        Conservative one - some nominally progressive groups like the LGB alliance and radical feminists have also 
                        rallied around their concerns about transgender rights. Because of this, the LGBT+ movement must also shift its focus 
                        to supporting transgender rights - as explained before, attacks on trans rights will inevitably also turn 
                        into attacks on LGBT+ rights in general.</p>

                    <p>In addition to the legal recognition of gay marriage, Pride has been successful in ingraining its message 
                        within American culture and politics. Today, many political institutions in the US are openly supportive of 
                        Pride events - for example, the University of Utah sponsored their own Pride parade in 2021. In the south, 
                        the University of Tennessee simply had an article on their website directing people to other websites that 
                        discussed LGBT+ history. Current president Joe Biden has <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1664285862245601281">tweeted support for the LGBT+ movement</a> and <a href="https://www.advocate.com/gay-pride-parade/gop-pride-flag-violation">hung 
                        pride flags from the white house</a>. It is debatable how much of this is <em>real</em> support for LGBT+ rights - 
                        as nice as website articles and tweets are, they are not actual institutional change. That being said, if 
                        nothing else all of these are signs that LGBT+ rights are now popular enough to be advertised politicians hoping for re-election.</p>

                    <h3>Commercialization</h3>
                    <p>As pride has grown more popular, it has received institutional support not just from the government but also from corporations. 
                        This is an issue that is more controversial within and without the Pride movement. It a good thing to show off being openly gay while protesting for the rights of yourself 
                        and others - but being sponsored by Pepsi while doing so may muddy the message. This phenomenon can also be a distraction from 'actual' political issues that are much 
                        more important - instead of having a candid debate about the place of transgender people in American society, it is easy for politicians and pundits to change the subject 
                        and simply complain about how Pride has become corporate - "how could these people be oppressed if so many companies have rainbow pictures on their twitters for a month?". 
                        Commercialization is both good and bad for the Pride movement. It signals larger institutional and cultural support, and can itself influence popular culture in favor of 
                        the LGBT+ movement. However, it can also bring scrutiny to the movement, as that commercial support â€“ which is sometimes invited and sometimes not â€“ can create the 
                        impression that LGBT+ people already have all the institutional support they need.</p>

                <h3>Shifting Focus</h3>
                <p>Today, the fight for gay marriage having been won, lesbians, gays, and bisexuals stand at a fairly decent spot 
                    within American society. This is not to say everything is perfect - in fact, since the legal argument that 
                    got gay marriage legalized relied on precedent from Roe v. Wade, <a href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hollycorbett/2022/06/28/representation-matters-the-impact-of-overturning-roe-v-wade-on-lgbtq-rights/?sh=6666f883155a">now overturned</a>, gay marriage could even be 
                    at risk in the near future. For the moment, though, the focus of the pride movement is generally shifting onto 
                    the rights of other communities within the movement. An interviewee at <a href="https://youtu.be/GiH1sakD4FY?t=273">Chicago Pride 2022</a> put it candidly: 
                    "Pride right now is not about white men anymore. It's about our marginalized communities within the gay 
                    community." This especially includes those whose rights are currently under national scrutiny, such as 
                    transgender people, and those who do not benefit from race and class privileges, such as LGBT+ people of color.</p>
                    <p>In addition to a shift in general sentiment, transgender people have also become much more visible and vocal within the LGBT+ community. This is shown in, among other things, LGBT+ activism done on the internet, and especially on YouTube. Transgender creators such as Natalie Wynn â€“ and her channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ContraPoints">ContraPoints</a> â€“ and Abigail Thorne â€“ and her channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PhilosophyTube/videos">Philosophy Tube</a> â€“ have become major sources for not just trans voices but LGBT+ voices in general. At the time of writing, ContraPoints has nearly 2 million subscribers, with its most popular video having over 6 million views, and Philosophy Tube has nearly 1.5 million subscribers with its most popular video having over 3 million views. This is not just a sign of more transgender voices in Pride, but also the growing importance of LGBT+ activism online. In contrast to the views on Contrapoints' and Philosophy Tube's videos, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/25/nyregion/nyc-pride-march.html">largest Pride march of 2022</a> in New York had 75,000 marchers and an estimated 2 million spectators.</p>
                    <p>This shift is not just a move to fight for people's rights. It is also a somewhat necessary pivot to remain 
                    politically relevant. Ever since the victory of gay marriage in 2015, the American public largely considers 
                    the fight for gay rights as "won" - whether or not that's actually true. To remain politically relevant the 
                    Pride movement therefore needs to find new grounds to fight on. This does not make the fight for the rights 
                    of transgender people and other minorities less important or less genuine, but simply that the pivot towards 
                    other marginalized groups within the LGBT+ spectrum is both necessary and strategic.</p>

            <h2>The Future of Pride</h2>
            <h3>Pride's Strengths</h3>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6" id="tucson-image" title="Celebrators at the Tucson Pride Festival"></div>
                <div class="col-md-6 my-auto">
                    <p>One of pride's main strengths, and something it should continue to focus on, has been its ability to influence
                        popular culture. By hosting parades, instead of
                       protests, pride invites everyone - including bystanders and allies - to participate. People who would normally
                       not show up to march at a protest, not being willing to risk their safety, can easily attend a pride parade to support
                       the community, and even have a fun time. This invites the rest of culture to not just <em>tolerate</em> LGBT+ people,
                       but to <em>enjoy</em> their presence. This, together with more traditional activism, has created a wave of celebration
                       of LGBT+ people and their identities, importantly and increasingly so in mainstream American media, compounding
                       the effect of the movement.
                   </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p class="mt-3">Another very important rhetorical strength of the LGBT+ movement which should continue to be emphasized is its intersectionality.
                 This was created in the past by expanding the umbrella of the movement to also include bisexual and transgender people after
                the gay rights movement gained traction. In addition to this, the pride movement embraces the struggles of many other groups,
                such as black rights and womenâ€™s rights activism. This is possible because many of the rights that LGBT+ people fight for
                are not exclusive to LGBT+ people, but applicable to progressive movements in general. For example, the argument that won Roe v. Wade and the 
                right to abortion in the USA, that the people have a right to privacy and bodily autonomy from the government, was the same 
                argument that was used to argue for the right to gay marriage. The rights that transgender people fight for - those of bodily
                autonomy, the right to self-affirming care, redefining what constitutes medically necessary care, access to things like 
                birth control and hormonal regulators, etc. - are all struggles that trans people share in common with feminism. This means that 
                the LGBT+ movement is strengthened by, and strengthens, the success of many other movements.
            </p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6 my-auto"><h3>Pride's Weaknesses</h3>
                    <p>By focusing so much on changing cultural attitudes, Pride has been extremely slow to obtain legal recognition 
                        of its goals. For a comparison, we can consider the trajectory of the Civil Rights Movement. 
                        While much black activism existed before it, for the sake of argument we can consider the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which 
                        began in 1955, as a starting point for the Civil Rights Movement of that era. From the boycott 
                        to the passing of the Civil Rights Act, when the movement gained federal and legal recognition, was a period of
                        9 years. Similarly, while much activism existed before it, we can consider the Stonewall Riot to be the inciting 
                        incident of the LGBT+ Pride movement. It took 46 years - from 1969 to 2015 - for the Pride movement to go from 
                        the Stonewall Riot to federal legalization of gay marriage. The pride movement could stand to focus more on 
                        actual political and legal gains, and perhaps expand its activities to more than simple parades - pride organizations 
                        should also focus on direct action, boycotts, marches, and other forms of protest throughout the year, rather than 
                        simply on parades every June.</p>

                <div class="col-md-6" id="glf-image" title="Gay Liberation Front at Pride 1970"></div>
            </div>
            <p>While one of Pride's main strengths today is its intersectionality, this has not always been the case. The Pride movement began as exclusive to gay and lesbian rights, and was primarily headed by white, middle class, gay men. As the movement expanded this changed, although not without its controversy. Movements like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGB_Alliance">LGB alliance</a> seek to reject transgender people from the Pride movement, and by doing so seek to reverse the progress made by intersectionality. There are also others that seek to reject the LGBT+ movement's attempt to include their movements in intersectionality - for example, some feminists have deemed themselves various labels such as "Transgender Exclusionary Radical Feminist" (TERF), "Gender Critical", etc., in attempts to distance the feminist movement from the LGBT+ movement, and especially from transgender people. While discussing the merits and downfalls of the radical feminist position is outside the purview of this essay, I can recommend <a href="https://youtu.be/1pTPuoGjQsI">this argumentative video essay</a> by Contrapoints - who I will note is biased against the trans-exlusionary position since she is a trans woman herself. Regardless of the merits of those positions, intersectionality and coalition-building is something that is extremely important for Pride's success, and so the inclusion of transgender people in Pride and its intersectionality still remains important on a strategic level.</p>
            <h3 class="mt-3">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>With the legalization of gay marriage, the passing of many protections for LGBT+ people on state levels, and 
                increasing support from politicians, the LGBT+ Pride movement has made huge strides since its beginnings
                in the 1970s. There is still a long way to go, especially for the rights of transgender people. The task now
                is to retain Pride's political momentum - rather than just its cultural momentum - to ensure that 
                Pride can continue to improve LGBT+ rights. To do this, it must embrace its intersectionality and 
                also focus on more explicit political activism.
