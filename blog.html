                <p>Fascists and Conservatives - even dictatorial Conservatives - do not share the same beliefs. There is one important difference between Fascist thought 
                    and Conservative thought that I'd like to elaborate on here since I didn't get the chance to in <a href="origin.html">The Origins of Fascism</a>. In that article 
                    I made the case that Fascism was developed out of the destruction of the old Conservative world order during World War One. This is true - but Fascism was not 
                    the only new right-wing ideology to be born out of the Great War.</p>
                <p>Just as with Fascism, the new right-wing ideologies of the 1900s were heavily influenced by nationalism and the experience of the Great War. However, an important 
                    aspect of Conservatism is that it seeks to preserve, or return to, the status quo. Monarchism did not completely die in the Great War, and in the interwar period 
                    Neo-Monarchism came into vogue in various European states. While traditional monarchists usually justified the place of a king on religious grounds, 
                    neo-monarchists generally justified it on nationalist grounds. Far-right nationalist movements sometimes embraced modernity, but as a method 
                    to preserve the status quo. The Italian Nationalist Association, for example, hoped to use the advent of modern machinery, industry, and weaponry to 
                    maintain the class and political system of Italy. Yet others on the right-wing drifted towards Liberalism as a method to ensure the status quo. The constitution of 
                    a nation could ensure the status-quo remained unchanged; the free market could be adjusted to ensure those who were already on top stayed on top. A myriad of 
                    different right-wing movements were created out of the Great War, and only "Liberal Conservatism" (Neoliberalism) survived World War Two with 
                    a significant presence in western political parties.</p>
                <p>When I say "right-wing", I generally mean belief systems that seek to create and enforce hierarchy. In the case of Conservatism, the goal is to continue the 
                    present hierarchy. Fascism, in contrast, is much more apocalyptic in its messaging. In <a href="origin.html">The Origins of Fascism</a> I briefly mentioned the 
                    influence of the left-leaning Futurists on early Fascism. The core Futurist belief which carried into Fascism is that <em>everything</em> that signified the "old ways" 
                    was decrepit and stopping humanity from reaching their true potential. The "old ways", to Fascists, included Liberals, Communists, and Conservatives. Fascists did 
                    not see themselves as just another Conservative movement, but as the next revolutionary ideology here to destroy the old world after Liberalism and Communism had failed to. 
                    This is the most important difference: Conservatives seek to preserve the existing hierarchy; Fascists seek to destroy it and build a new one in their own image.</p>

                <p>That being said, Fascists are still right-wing, and in practice they can be very flexible with their beliefs. Fascist political strategy - in the 1900s and today - 
                    involves constantly changing the beliefs they advocate depending on who they're talking to. This lets them find recruits almost anywhere - they present themselves as 
                    "the true party of the workers, unlike those darn Socialists" when talking in factories. They present themselves as "useful right-wing thugs" when talking to Conservative 
                    generals, kings, and politicians. So-on-and-so-fourth. Because of this, Fascism in practice can look and act like Conservatism, and often allys itself with 
                    other right-wing movements. Both Mussolini and Hitler relied on the approval of various Conservatives to get them in power (while those Conservatives considered 
                    Mussolini and Hitler to be "useful idiots" for their own schemes). Fascism can also end up somewhat Conservative in practice - it is easy to stage a revolution, 
                    much more difficult to build a functioning state. Nearly all of the Fascist regimes of the 1900s had to rely on alliances with Conservatives to stay in power - the only 
                    generally accepted exception to this rule was Nazi Germany. Still, Fascism should not be understood as a simple form of Conservative or capitalist dictatorship. 
                    It is an entirely unique beast.</p>

            <h3 id="should-we-call-people-fascist">Should we call people Fascist?</h3>
            <p class="date">February 1st, 2024. ~300 words.</p>
            <p>Present-day politics - especially online - often devolves into useless arguments over semantics. This is especially true of conversations about Fascism. 
                Because of that, I'd like to talk about how I feel about calling people Fascist, regardless of whether some particular person is <em>actually</em> Fascist.</p>
            <p>A large part of Fascist strategy - today and in the 1900s - has been to disguise themselves as "just some very radical conservatives". This is an undeniably 
                useful political strategy for them to use. The confusion about who is and is not a Fascist is not a mistake. It's hard to say whether calling out Fascistic 
                beliefs is buying in to that scheme or not.</p>
            <p>The way I see it, we should point out negative beliefs when we see them, regardless of whether we use the term 
                "Fascist" or not. Historically there has been debate over whether the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco was a Fascist or just a right-wing authoritarian. 
                There is sometimes use in this distinction, but also - what does it matter? A brutal dictatorship is bad and evil regardless of what political label 
                gets applied to it. Using the term Fascist to describe modern politicians may sometimes be useful - and even accurate - but the effect is often to derail the conversation 
                away from discussing the negative aspects of someone's beliefs and towards a useless semantic debate over the definition of Fascism. It's not that you should 
                never use the word Fascist, but you should consider what sort of conversation you want to have when discussing some politicians beliefs. Is the debate over who is and 
                who isnt a Fascist really better than pointing out someone's specific wrongdoings and beliefs? This is a question that has a different answer for each person and 
                conversation, but it's an important question to ask before we use "the F word".</p>
