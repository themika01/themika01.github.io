            <h3 class="center">Quick Summary</h3>
            <p>During the 1800s the two competing ideologies of Europe were between the Liberal capitalist democracies and the Conservative traditional monarchies. 
                During World War One, the Conservative European powers of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Russia were all destroyed and rebuilt under either Liberalism or Socialism. 
                The destruction of the Conservative order forced right-wing Europeans to consider new approaches to their ideology, and landed on nationalism. Meanwhile, left-leaning 
                movements disilusioned with Communism, such as Syndicalists, found nationalism to be an interesting idea. The specific historic circumstances in Italy in the 1920s 
                then created an atmosphere where an impossible combination of left-wing revolutionaries, capitalist Liberals, and right-wing reactionary nationalists formed the first Fascist party.

            <h3 class="center">Liberals & Conservatives</h3>
            <p>In the late  1700s an idea which had been brewing in revolutionary circles across European societies - Liberalism - finally broke on to the world stage
                with the American and French revolutions. Liberals in the 18th century defined themselves against their enemies, Conservatives. The old Conservative powers were
                mainly ruled by kings, supported old aristocracy over rising capitalists, and had no protections for civil liberties. Liberals were the opposite. They 
                believed in representative democracy, capitalism, and guaranteed personal freedoms of speech and religion. This is important to understand: when I say Liberal,
                I mean the <em>old</em> version of the Liberal tradition, which encapsulates most of the beliefs of almost every "liberal"/"conservative" political party in the west today. 
                Over the course of the 1800s various European states adopted Liberal constitutions. These included two of the most powerful nations in the world, Britain and France. 
                Italy also adopted a Liberal constitution when it united in 1870. Against Liberalism stood the forces of Conservatives, found in Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Russia.

            <h3 class="center">Destruction of the Conservative Order</h3>
            <p>Classical Conservatives of the 1800s believed that God himself had created society to be ruled by kings over their lands. By 1900, it was clear that belief system was no longer tenable. 
                The western-European colonial empires grew rich while operating under Liberalism, at least in their home territories. Additionally, Liberal values had become widespread in Germany and 
                parts of the Austro-Hungarian empire. In Russia, Liberals - and Communists - destabilized the imperial regime. The final breaking point for Conservatism came with World War One.
                The Treaty of Versailles, signed in the summer of 1919, forced Germany and the new states created out of the Austrian empire to become Liberal republics. The other bastion of Conservatism, 
                Russia, fell to Communist revolution in 1917. The Conservative order was left without any major European power to support it, and the right wing in general was forced to reconsider its assumptions about the world.

            <h3 class="center">The New Right-Wing</h3>
            <p>The Conservative order needed to find new justifications and methods for preserving the status-quo. The new justification the right found was nationalism<a href="#foot1"><sup id="leg1">1</sup></a>. At its most basic form, nationalism is 
                simply the idea that a group of people who share similar traits should be able to form a nation. The similar traits can be almost anything: culture, religion, ethnicity, political beliefs, etc. Conservatives found 
                nationalism to be a useful tool for justifying inequality in wealth distribution, the place of kings and aristocrats, religion in government policy, and so on. 
                A right-wing justification of policy on the grounds of nationalism could sound something like: "The place of a king in society is a tradition that goes as far back as the Roman Caesars. If the people of Italy are to succeed as a nation, we need a monarchy!"
                Nationalism was traditionally a non-partisan political issue; it was used by Liberals, Conservatives, and even some Socialists to justify their aspirations. Because of this, right-wing nationalism often found a ready audience 
                among typically left-leaning thinkers.

            <h3 class="center">Nationalization of the Left</h3>
            <p>Many of the original founders of the first Fascist parties were left leaning. One major left-wing movement in Europe immediately before the start of World War One were the Futurists. 
                Futurists believed that machinery, industry, and technology could bring about a utopian world. Futurists were mostly Liberals, and they were some of the most open supporters of granting women the right to vote in Italy. 
                Futurists believed that the old institutions of Conservative Europe could only be destroyed by war, which was a necessary price for a better, more democratic world<a href="#foot2"><sup id="leg2">2</sup></a>. 
                Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, who wrote the <em>Manifesto of Futurism</em> in 1909, would go on to join the Italian Fascist Party in 1919.
            </p>
            <p>The influence of left-leaning non-Marxists on Fascism is undeniable. One major ideology that influenced Fascism was Syndicalism. To over-simplify things, Syndicalism is the belief that workers' ownership of 
                production should not come through the violent destruction of capitalism (as in Marxism) but through mostly peaceful labor-union action. Many of the original Fascists were ex-Socialists turned Syndicalists, which 
                was reflected in the first official program of the Italian Fascists of 1919. The program called for democratic, feminist, socialistic reforms<a href="#foot3"><sup id="leg3">3</sup></a>. Mussolini himself was an ex-Socialist, 
                having been the director of the Socialist newspaper <em>Avanti!</em> from 1912 to 1914. Another prominent Fascist, Enrico Ferri, was director of <em>Avanti!</em> from 1903 to 1908<a href="#foot4"><sup id="leg4">4</sup></a>. The first Fascists were mainly 
                ex-Socialists who had been influenced by nationalism.

        <div class="content-div">
            <h3 class="center">Italy, Specifically</h3>
            <p>Fascism first arose in Italy, making impossible to consider the origins of Fascism without the specific circumstances Italy went through in the 1910s and 20s. Italy joined World War One late - in 1915 - 
                at least partially due to a strong organized anti-war sentiment in its population. The anti-war movement were called the "neutralists", while the pro-war movement were called the <a href="#foot5"><sup id="leg5">5</sup></a>"interventionists". 
                Some interventionists - including Mussolini - justified the war on nationalist grounds, while Liberals typically saw it as a "democratic crusade"<a href="#foot6"><sup id="leg6">6</sup></a>. 
                The first political meeting in Italy that called themselves "Fasci" was a group of 200 people, including Mussolini, in 1919. It was primarily a gathering of nationalist-interventionists, who held a wide 
                range of views, including Futurism, feminism, and Syndicalism. Despite many of the <em>Fasci</em> being Syndicalist, extreme anti-Socialism was a common belief in the group<a href="#foot7"><sup id="leg7">7</sup></a>. 
                The inconsistent, moderately left-nationalist views of the original <em>Fasci</em> had no political success. Violence, however, did bring it success.

            </div>
            <p>A few months after their first meeting, the <em>Fasci</em> embarked on an "expedition" to destroy the headquarters of the Socialist <em>Avanti!</em> newspaper. Massive Socialist 
                electoral success in 1920 led to increased fears from the middle and upper-classes of Italy of a Communist takeover. They came to see Fascist violence as a useful tool to combat Socialism. 
                Funding and membership in the Fascist party grew rapidly, but now mainly from the reactionary right rather than the left. Some leftists left the party in disgust, while others converted to the right wing easily<a href="#foot8"><sup id="leg8">8</sup></a>. 
                By 1921 the Fascist party was openly calling for a right-wing dictatorship as the only way to save Italy from evil Communists and inept Liberals. Despite this, of the four men who coordinated the 1922 coup which put the Italian Fascists in power, 
                two were monarchists, one was a former Liberal, and one was a former Syndicalist<a href="#foot9"><sup id="leg9">9</sup></a>. The Fascists had used nationalism and violence to convince, or swindle, reactionaries and moderates into working together.</p>
