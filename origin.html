            <p>The history of the 1800s can be viewed as a competition between a Conservative, monarchist, tradition and a new Liberal, constitutionalist, force. 
                Through this lens the competition ended when the Conservative European powers of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Russia were all destroyed and rebuilt under either Liberalism or Communism. 
                The destruction of the Conservative order forced right-wing Europeans to consider new approaches to their ideology. Meanwhile, left-leaning 
                movements disilusioned with Communism, such as Syndicalists, also searched for new political grounds. Many of the people 
                searching for new belief systems were also veterans of the Great War, and the violence and mass-dehumanization of the conflict influenced how those veterans saw the world. The specific historic circumstances in Italy in the 1920s 
                then created an atmosphere where various anti-Socialist, anti-Liberal politicians from across the political spectrum formed the first Fascist party.

            <h3 class="center">Liberals & Conservatives</h3>
            <p>In the late  1700s an idea which had been brewing in revolutionary circles across European societies - Liberalism - broke on to the world stage
                with the American and French revolutions<sup>1</sup>. Liberals in the 18th century defined themselves against their enemies, Conservatives. The old Conservative powers were
                mainly ruled by kings and ruled without any formal separation of powers in government - the king ruled over all. Liberals were the opposite. They 
                believed that countries needed constitutions to limit the power of their leaders, and generally to guaruntee freedoms to their people such as freedom of speech and religion><sup>2</sup>. This is important to understand: when I say Liberal,
                I mean the <em>old</em> version of the Liberal tradition, which encapsulates most of the beliefs of almost every "liberal"/"conservative" political party in the west today. 
                Over the course of the 1800s various European states adopted Liberal positions. These included two of the most powerful nations in the world, Britain and France. 
                Italy also adopted a Liberal-leaning constitution when it united in the later 1800s. Against Liberalism stood the forces of Conservative monarchies, found in Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Russia.

            <h3 class="center">Destruction of the Conservative Order</h3>
            <p>Classical Conservatives of the 1800s believed that God himself had created society to be ruled by kings over their lands. By 1900, it was clear that belief system was no longer tenable. 
                The western-European colonial empires grew rich while operating under Liberalism, at least in their home territories. Additionally, Liberal values had become widespread in Germany and 
                parts of the Austro-Hungarian empire. In Russia, Liberals - and Communists - destabilized the imperial regime. The final breaking point for Conservatism came with World War One<sup >3</sup>.
                The Treaty of Versailles, signed in the summer of 1919, forced Germany and the new states created out of the Austrian empire to become Liberal republics. The other bastion of Conservatism, 
                Russia, fell to Communist revolution in 1917. The Conservative order was left without any major European power to support it, and the right wing in general was forced to reconsider its assumptions about the world.

            <h3 class="center">The New Right-Wing</h3>
            <p>The Conservative order needed to find new justifications and methods for preserving the status-quo. The new justification the right found was nationalism<sup>4</sup>. At its most basic form, nationalism is 
                simply the idea that a group of people who share similar traits should be able to form a nation. The similar traits can be almost anything: culture, religion, ethnicity, political beliefs, etc. Conservatives found 
                nationalism to be a useful tool for justifying inequality in wealth distribution, the place of kings and aristocrats, religion in government policy, and so on. 
                A right-wing justification of policy on the grounds of nationalism could sound something like: "The place of a king in society is a tradition that goes as far back as the Roman Caesars. If the people of Italy are to succeed as a nation, we need a monarchy!"
                Nationalism was traditionally a non-partisan political issue; it was used by Liberals, Conservatives, and even some Socialists to justify their aspirations. Because of this, right-wing nationalism often found a ready audience 
                among typically left-leaning thinkers.
            </p>
            <p>The development of the new right was heavily influenced by the experience of the Great War. A huge number of Fascists in the 1920s and '30s - including 
                Mussolini and Hitler - were World War One veterans. Military experience influenced nearly every development of the new right and Fascism<sup>5</sup>. The turn towards 
                collective and authoritarian thought was reflective of military training and structures. Dehumanizing those considered to be the "enemy" to justify violence, practiced widely in the new right 
                and especially Fascists, was reflective of military and nationalistic propaganda. The idea that violence and warfare are a means to improve society 
                was inherent both to pro-war propaganda during World War One and Fascist beliefs immediately afterwards.

            <h3 class="center">Nationalization of the Left</h3>
            <p>Many of the original founders of the first Fascist parties were left leaning, such as the Futurists, who 
                believed that machinery, industry, and technology could bring about a utopian world. Futurists were mostly Liberals, and they were some of the most open supporters of granting women the right to vote in Italy. 
                Futurists believed that the old institutions of Conservative Europe could only be destroyed by war, which was a necessary price for a better, more democratic world<sup>6</sup>. 
                Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, who wrote the <em>Manifesto of Futurism</em> in 1909, would go on to join the Italian Fascist Party in 1919.
            </p>
            <p>The influence of left-leaning non-Marxists on Fascism is undeniable. One major ideology that influenced Fascism was Syndicalism. To over-simplify things, Syndicalism is the belief that workers' ownership of 
                production should not come through the violent destruction of capitalism (as in Marxism) but through mostly peaceful labor-union action. After World War One, many Syndicalists became disillusioned with the Liberal establishment and became more openly violent in their rhetoric. 
                Many of the original Fascists were Syndicalists, which was reflected in the first official program of the Italian Fascists of 1919. The program called for democratic, feminist, socialistic reforms<sup>7</sup>. Mussolini himself was an ex-Socialist, 
                having been the director of the Socialist newspaper <em>Avanti!</em> from 1912 to 1914. Another prominent Fascist, Enrico Ferri, was director of <em>Avanti!</em> from 1903 to 1908<sup>8</sup>. 
                The first Fascists were mainly ex-Socialists Great War veterans who had been influenced by nationalism and their military experiences.

            <h3 class="center">Italy, Specifically</h3>
            <p>Fascism first arose in Italy, making impossible to consider the origins of Fascism without the specific circumstances Italy went through in the 1910s and 20s. Italy joined World War One late - in 1915 - 
                at least partially due to a strong organized anti-war sentiment in its population. The anti-war movement were called the "neutralists", while the pro-war movement were called the "interventionists"<sup>9</sup>. 
                Some interventionists - including Mussolini - justified the war on nationalist grounds, while Liberals typically saw it as a "democratic crusade"<sup>10</sup>. 
                The first political meeting in Italy that called themselves "Fasci" was a group of 200 interventionists, including Mussolini, in 1919. It was primarily a gathering of nationalist-interventionists, who held a wide 
                range of views, including Futurism, feminism, and Syndicalism. A common belief throughout the whole group, however, was anti-Socialism<sup>11</sup>. The Fascists interpreted World War One as Italy's violent crusade against it's external enemies - 
                now, they hoped to bring the fight to Italy's internal enemies<sup>12</sup>. The inconsistent, moderately left-nationalist views of the original <em>Fasci</em> had no political success. Their commitment to anti-Socialist violence, however, did bring it success.

            </div>
            <p>Massive Socialist electoral success in 1919 made Liberals and the Right wing of Italy anxious about a potential Communist revolution. Many of them came to see Fascist violence as a useful tool to combat Socialism. 
                The Fascist movement founds recruits and funding because of their anti-Communist sentiments and penchant for violence. Middle class urbanites, workers disillusioned with Socialism, landlords in the countryside, and peasants in the countryside all flocked to the Fascist banner. 
                Funding and membership in the Fascist party grew rapidly, but now mainly from Liberals and the reactionary right rather than the left. Some leftists left the party in disgust, while others converted to the right wing easily<sup>13</sup>. 
                One influence on Fascism from the right was the increasing hatred displayed not only towards Communism but also against Liberalism. In the Italian countryside, Fascists regularly overturned Liberal elections by staging riots until politicians resigned<sup>14</sup>.
                By 1921 the Fascist party was openly calling for a right-wing dictatorship as the only way to save Italy from evil Communists and inept Liberals. Of the four men who coordinated the 1922 coup which put the Italian Fascists in power, 
                two were monarchists, one was a former Liberal, and one was a former Syndicalist<sup>15</sup>. Out of the experiences of the Great War, the veterans of Italy forged a new violent and nationlist ideology out of various anti-Liberal and anti-Socialist ideologies.</p>
